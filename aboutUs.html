        <h1>Here We Are !</h1>
        <p>
          Our food system is broken. Some people don’t have enough food, while
          others are eating too much. There’s only one way to fix this
          problem—and it starts with you and me. Food Tank is for the 7 billion
          people who have to eat every day. We will offer solutions and
          environmentally sustainable ways of alleviating hunger, obesity, and
          poverty by creating a network of connections and information for all
          of us to consume and share. Food Tank is for farmers and producers,
          policy makers and government leaders, researchers and scientists,
          academics and journalists, and the funding and donor communities to
          collaborate on providing sustainable solutions for our most pressing
          environmental and social problems. As much as we need new thinking on
          global food system issues, we also need new doing. Around the world,
          people and organizations have developed innovative, on-the-ground
          solutions to the most pressing issues in food and agriculture. Through
          years of field visits (and years of trying to eat better in her own
          community) our President Danielle Nierenberg has helped to highlight
          and promote these best practices. Today, we hope to bridge the
          domestic and global food issues by highlighting how hunger, obesity,
          climate change, unemployment, and other problems can be solved by more
          research and investment in sustainable agriculture. Food Tank
          highlights hope and success in agriculture. We feature innovative
          ideas that are already working on the ground, in cities, in kitchens,
          in fields and in laboratories. These innovations need more attention,
          more research, and ultimately more funding to be replicated and
          scaled-up. And that is where we need you. We all need to work together
          to find solutions that nourish ourselves and protect the planet. Food
          Tank is a 501(c)3 non profit organization. All donations and
          membership dues are tax deductible.
